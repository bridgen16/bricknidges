        <p>My inspiring figure is the renowned and famous guitarist, John Mayer. Though his track record in the media has made him 
            seem like he wouldn't sound like the most inspiring person on the planet. Over the past decade, he has changed into a 
            much more slefless person and musician. One of the most popular bands in rock and roll in the 60's and 70's, the Grateful 
            Dead, began playing with Mayer calling the group Dead and Company in 2015. Mayer attributed his change in persona for the 
            better to playing with Dead and Comapny because of the pure and wholehearted message the Grateful Dead encompassed.</p>
        <p>Mayer is my personal hero not only as a person who has changed themselves for the better but I believe that he is the 
           greatest guitarist of my genereation. As a blues guitarist myself,  i've attempted to learn as much as I can from many different 
           guitarists. Though my studying focuses on many musiscians, it's easy to say that John Mayer is the one I attempt to learn from the most </p>
